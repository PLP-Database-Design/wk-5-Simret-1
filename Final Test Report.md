## Project Overview

**System Under Test:** Word Puzzle Game Plus  
**Technology Stack:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
**Environment:** Chrome Browser (Desktop)

### Features Under Test

| Feature | Description | Risk Category |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Reset Game | Clears score and progress instantly | High |
| Leaderboard | Stores top 3 scores in localStorage | Medium |
| Bonus Round | Every 3 puzzles ‚Üí doubles score | Critical |

## Test Plan

### Objectives

- Validate correctness and stability of new features: Reset Game, Leaderboard, and Bonus Round.

- Assess data integrity, state management, and UI consistency after user actions.

- Identify, prioritize, and mitigate high-risk areas through risk-based testing.

- Ensure defect tracking, metrics monitoring, and controlled regression testing.

### Scope

**In Scope:**
- Functional testing of:

Reset Game (state reset and persistence)

Leaderboard (localStorage top-3 logic)

Bonus Round (scoring arithmetic and triggers)

- UI behavior and event sequencing

- Cross-browser validation (Chrome focus)

- Risk-based and boundary testing

**Out of Scope:**
- Backend integrations (none implemented)

- Performance load testing

- Accessibility beyond basic ARIA role checks

### Tools & Resources

## Risk Analysis

### Risks

| ID | Feature | Risk Description | Likelihood | Impact | Priority | Mitigation Strategy |
|----|---------|------------------|------------|--------|----------|---------------------|
| R1 | Reset Game | State not cleared (score persists) | 3 | 4 | 12 - High | Verify variables reset; unit test on reset() |
| R2 | Leaderboard | Incorrect sorting or missing score | 2 | 5 | 10 - High | Test various score sequences; clear storage |
| R3 | Leaderboard | localStorage unavailable (quota, privacy) | 3 | 3 | 9 - Medium | Mock localStorage and fallback UI |
| R4 | Bonus Round | Incorrect score multiplier (math bug) | 3 | 5 | 15 - Critical | Verify modulo logic; regression after each fix |
| R5 | UI Controls | Reset or Submit unresponsive | 2 | 4 | 8 - Medium | Test event listeners and disable states |
| R6 | Data Integrity | Score overflow or NaN due to invalid data | 2 | 4 | 8 - Medium | Validate score type and boundary inputs |
### Risk Coverage
- Total Risks: 6

- Tested Risks: 5

- Untested Risks: 1 (R3 non-functional fallback)

- Risk Coverage Ratio: 5/6 = 83%

## Overall Summary

**Statement:** 
- Risk-Based Testing Impact:
Risk analysis directly focused testing on the most error-prone logic (bonus scoring, leaderboard persistence). This improved time efficiency and prevented redundant low-value tests.

- Trade-offs:
Limited time prevented deep usability testing. Focus on high-risk features ensured coverage of most impactful defects.

- Collaboration Insights:
GitHub Issues streamlined communication between testers and developers. Immediate evidence uploads (screenshots) improved turnaround time for fixes.

I- mprovements:

Automate localStorage clearing between runs.

Implement unit tests for score calculation.

Add CI pipeline to track test metrics automatically.

Most Defect-Prone Feature: Bonus Round logic (arithmetic and trigger condition).
